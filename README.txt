Limit 
=====
Limit is a program developed using Processing. The paths
for the falling balls are defined by a series of random 
variables. Vertical bars are drawn based on the final
location of each ball. After many balls land, the bars 
take on a Gaussian distribution. 
This demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem.
