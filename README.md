Limit 
=====

Limit is a program developed using [Processing](http://processing.org/). 
The paths for the falling balls are defined by a series 
of random variables. Vertical bars are drawn based on the 
final location of each ball. After many balls land, the 
bars take on a Gaussian distribution. 
This demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem.

User Controls
